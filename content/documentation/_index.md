# Documentation

The documentation  is designed for beginners who want to get started with a GServlet application from scratch. GServlet is built on top the Servlet API and it is running on the Groovy programming language. If you have no prior experience with Groovy, you will find a very steep learning curve diving straight into it. There are several curated lists of online resources for learning Groovy: 

* [Official Groovy Programming Language website](https://groovy-lang.org)
* [List of Programming Books](https://groovy-lang.org/learn.html#books)

The documentation is split into two categories for each release:

* The _Reference guide_ for those who want to know how to develop applications with the API
* The _Javadocs_ for those who want to grasp the design of the API

## Reference Guide

* [1.0.0](/docs/1.0.0) 


## Javadocs

* [1.0.0](/javadocs/1.0.0)
