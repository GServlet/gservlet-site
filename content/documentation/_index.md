# Documentation

The documentation  is designed for beginners who want to get started with a GServlet application from scratch. GServlet is built on top the Servlet API which it aims to simplify and it is running on the Groovy programming language. 

{{% notice note %}}
If you have no prior experience with Groovy, there are several curated lists of online resources for learning it.
