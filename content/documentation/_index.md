# Documentation

The documentation  is designed for beginners who want to get started with a GServlet application from scratch. GServlet is built on top the Servlet API which it aims to simplify and it is running on the Groovy programming language.

If you have no prior experience with Groovy, there are several curated lists of online resources for learning it.
