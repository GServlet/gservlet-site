# Contribute

There are many ways in which you can get involved to help us make this project even better. We really appreciate and welcome contributions and you can help us by:

* Reporting or fixing issues
* Documenting various aspects of the API
* Covering the code base with more tests
* Contributing new features

## Reporting issues

You can search for existing issues, raise a new one or fix them. We use [GitHub's issue tracker](https://github.com/GServlet/gservlet-api/issues) to keep a track of all our issues.

## Improving the documentation

The documentation comes in various forms:

* The reference documentation built with [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/)
* The Javadocs APIs documenting the classes of the code base
* This website

All the above is stored in our code repositories on [Github](https://github.com/GServlet).

## Contributing code

If you know the area you want to contribute to, this is great, but if you are looking for some first contributions, we try to maintain a list of tickets of possible easy contributions that could get you started on your journey to become a committer. 

## Continuous Integration
As a continuous integration platform, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/GServlet/gservlet-api) supports our development process by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change.

## Continuous Code Quality
To eliminate bugs and vulnerabilities, the sources files are tested with [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=GServlet_gservlet-api).

## Tests Coverage
We use [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/GServlet/gservlet-api) to track our code coverage over time, and ensure that all our new code is fully covered.
