# Contribute

There are many ways in which you can get involved to help us make this project even better. We really appreciate and welcome contributions and you can help us by:

* Reporting or fixing issues you encounter in our bug tracker
* Documenting various aspects of the language or its APIs
* Covering the code base with more tests to avoid future regressions,
* Contributing bug fixes or new features

## Reporting issues

If you are wanting to search existing issues, raise a new one or are keen to fix some existing issues, then you should become familiar with GitHub's issue tracker.

## Improving the documentation

The documentation comes in various forms:

* The reference documentation covering the language specification, the user guides, getting started, and more.
* The Javadocs APIs documenting the classes of the GServlet code base
* This website

All the above is stored in our code repositories on Github, so having an account on Github would be ideal.

## Contributing code

If you know the area you want to contribute to, this is great, but if you are looking for some first contributions, we try to maintain a list of tickets of possible easy contributions that could get you started on your journey to become a committer. 

## Build status
The sources files are tested with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/GServlet/gservlet-api).
